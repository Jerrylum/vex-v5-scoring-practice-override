# VEX IQ Scoring Practice — Level Up

An interactive 3D web application for practicing [VIQRC Level Up](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/2026-2027/level-up/files/viqrc-level-up-0.1.2.pdf) (2026–2027) scoring. Count scored bean bags across pyramid goals, floor goals, and L4 goals, then check your total against the correct answer.

This project simplifies some edge cases for learning, but works well as a starting point for new scorekeeper referees and students learning the Level Up scoring system.

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level and click **New** to generate a random scenario.
2. Examine the 3D field and count **scored bean bags** for each goal tier using the panel on the right.
3. Use **−** and **+** to enter your counts. The panel shows your running point total.
4. Click **Check** to verify your answer and see the correct counts per goal.

### Scoring (2026–2027 Level Up)

| Goal  | Points per scored bean bag |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| Floor | 1                          |
| L1    | 3                          |
| L2    | 6                          |
| L3    | 12                         |
| L4    | 16                         |

In red and blue goals, **red/blue and yellow** bean bags can score. On the **L4 goal**, only **yellow** bean bags score.

### Scoring Panel

The panel tracks scored bean bags for:

- **Red Floor** and **Blue Floor**
- **Red/Blue L1, L2, and L3** (pyramid goals)
- **L4 Goal** (centered row)

Your total score is calculated automatically from the counts above.

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy

- Simple goal configurations
- Fewer bean bags per goal
- Floor goals may be empty or hold a single bean bag

### Medium

- More varied pyramid stacks
- Floor goals with multiple bean bags across stack positions

### Hard

- Mixed-color stacks (distractor bean bags that do not score)
- Invalid floor placements (bean bags that do not count as scored)
- More complex L4 configurations

## Scope & Limitations

This practice app focuses on **goal scoring** only. It does **not** currently include:

- Load zones or bean bags introduced during the match
- Preloads or bean bags remaining elsewhere on the field
- Robot contact rules (SC1–SC5 assume bean bags are not touching robots)

For the official scoring rules, see the [VIQRC Level Up Game Manual](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/2026-2027/level-up/files/viqrc-level-up-0.1.2.pdf).
